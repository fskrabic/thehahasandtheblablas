DAVID ICKE

i want to ride my bicycle
i want to ride my bike
when i grow up
i want to be like david icke, icke, icke

don't be like david icke
you don't wanna end up cookoo right
don't be one of those dumb fools
don't ever live by your own rules

don't listen to the voice in your head
listen to your government instead
you should listen to your mom and dad
when they say do your homework make your bed

don't question school teachers
watch the news regularly
on sundays listen to the preacher
behave as society dictates my dear

do not think on your own
or come up with conspiracies
you will end up alone
alone in your own misery

the biggest secret is so wicked
illuminati, anunnaki
i'm so lucky i'm so cocky
today

new world order i'm so sober
big conspiracy throught bureaucracy
reptoid humanoids
manipulating frequencies

authority new reality
fake self identity
turn on five senses
be aware of fantom self

infinite dimensions
subliminal messages
incredible tensions
it lasts for ages

human race get off your knees
remember who you are
love changes everything
yes it does

heal the world
do it yourself
do it together
repeat after me

i'm me i'm free
i'm me i'm free
i'm me i am free
i'm me i am free

i'm giving a like to david icke
i'm opening my heart to that guy
i'll follow him he's a good ally
people it's time to open our eyes

i want to be like david icke
i want to try i want to fight
i want to experience delight
love is what it's all about
