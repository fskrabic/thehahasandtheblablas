FRIEND FOR SALE

in the local newspaper
from two or three days ago
i saw a strange ad
strange enough

friend for sale

they went through a lot
they broke down easily
they spent a lot yes
and that's why now

friend for sale

a second-hand friend is for sale
very urgently
he is not particularly educated
but does it really matter

friend for sale

sometimes you sell a house
or an old piano
maybe one of your guitars
but a friend

put them on the black market
sell them below the price
trade them in for something else
is it worth it

no
