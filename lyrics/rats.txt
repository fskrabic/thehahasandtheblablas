a little rat lives in my flat
he's 45 he has a wife and two kids
don't know if he has a job or what
won't charge him rent times are tough life is rough and he don't laugh

when i think about it i never really saw him laughing
that's so sad his situation must be so bad
so i'm trying not to bother him no more
just wave in passing and say hello

haven't seen him for a while not even his kids or wife
maybe they moved away maybe he found a job
well we all know that's a lie we all know that they died
last week there was pest control in our building
