ONLY TIME HE CRIED

he's a person who can endure pain
or hardship without showing any feelings 
he does not complain
find him in a dictionary or encyclopedia britannica 
by his middle name
it's stoic not stojiÄ‡ 
remember that

one time he showed his feelings
he let a tear run down his face freely
for once in a lifetime he found himself in another part of the world
where emotions control our mind

only time that he cried
was when mufasa died
when scar drove his claws into his paws
