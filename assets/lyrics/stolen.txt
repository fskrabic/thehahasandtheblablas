STOLEN SONG 

sometimes i steal
without even knowing it
this time i know
i admit i stole

i stole this song from a guy named daniel
if this song is a hit i'll forever remember his name
in which case I invite him to contact me
so that i can pay him
about the percentage we will agree
there will be no problems i believe
i know daniel is a good man
and will sing along to this jam

theft is so sweet
when no one knows about it
oh dear lord
we could meet in court

but i only borrowed the music
the lyrics are entirely mine
i also arranged it myself
so this is my line
this one too
this same
and this one
and every next one

this song was stolen
like many others before
it's good for my wallet
when inspiration is gone

but as I've already said
daniel is a good boy
he may have not even notice
maybe he forgot
otherwise feel free to explain
if you meet him by chance
tell him it's nothing big
if you see him invite him to our gig

to be able to sing
to this stolen song
it would be a nice thing
if we could sing along

this song was stolen
like many others before
it's good for my wallet
daniel don't get me wrong

this song is perfect
don't spoil it now
restrain the ego daniel
this is the end
or maybe not
just a chorus one more time
are you ready  daniel
one two for free

this song was stolen
like many others before
it's good for my wallet
when inspiration is gone
dont get me wrong daniel
