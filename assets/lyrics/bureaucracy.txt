BUREAUCRACY

going by car or going on foot
always waiting for someone to move
always late and always in a hurry
that's how it must be so don't you worry
go here go there i'm going everywere
this paper is for this that paper is for that
but this paper you don't have
oh not again

and when i'm finally there 
the line is so big and nobody cares
not even trying to speed up 
to prepare all of the documents
finally my turn 
but sir you need counter number 2
how was i supposed to know that

after more queuing on counter number 2
let's see this paper is good but the stamp is missing
sorry come tomorrow my break's about to start
oh give me a break
give me a break
give me a break
give me a break
give me a break

after more trying one day i came with a bomb 
and solved all my problems for good
