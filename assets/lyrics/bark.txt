BARK!

i bark at the fascist cats
i bark at the redneck brats
i bark at the ignorant postman

i bark
it's bad music
bad music bad music
bark
it's bad music
for bad bad people

bark at the annoying fly
sometimes when it's too dark
i bark at the noisy trucks

it's bad music
bad music bad music
bark
it's bad music
for bad bad people

bark at the thief racoon
i bark at the full full moon
i bark at the aggressive douche

it's bad music
bad music bad music
bark
it's bad music
for bad bad people

bark at the mean kids
i bark at the bunch of priests
i bark but nobody hears

it's bad music
bad music bad music
bark
it's bad music
for bad bad people
